# Facial Rec Notebook and App
## Process and Credits
The whole point of this project was really just to jump right into machine learning and tackle a real world application; making a Facial Recognition model! I've had minor experince with ML before, but it really only scratched the surface, so I just wanted to learn a project that would expose me to deeper ML concepts. Almost all of this project was inspired from Nicholas Renotte and his facial rec series on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43eAC1LMrsU&list=PLgNJO2hghbmhHuhURAGbe6KWpiYZt0AMH&index=8

Along side his videos, I went through Google's machine learning crash course: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course
and read the the infamous "The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book" by Andriy Burkov. All three of these learning materials really went hand-in hand with each other to help me better grasp and understand more of the coding and mathematics behind machine learning. I'll admit that I am still super new, and still quite confused on a lot of topics, but I can't wait to learn about them! I will be taking a machine learning and evolutionary computing course in my next semester and I couldn't be more excited.

Working on this project, also gave me a huge appreication behind tools like tensorflow and pytroch. The people who paved the way to make libraries like that are quite remarkable, and I dream that I could make a contribution like that someday. I am also currently (as of July 2023) working on building an Nvidia jetbot, and hope to use this notebook on the bot!

## Packages for Juptyer Notebook
The only package required to run the juptyer notebook is this DataSet :

It will also be nice to have have juptyer installed lol, but I don't necessarily think that is a requirement.

## Packages For Facial Recogintion App
To run the Facial Recogintion App you will need to install
1. Kivy
2. Tensorflow
3. OpenCv

##Running Facial Recoginition App
To run the App use:
'''
python faceid.py
'''
